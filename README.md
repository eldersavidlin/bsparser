### Overview
Built using python 3.7.0

Help parse through Beat Saber songs - Query/Download/Delete

This is a menu driven program that will search through all of the songs in your CustomLevels Beat Saber Directory. It will then query those songs and save the data in a query.json or query_fail.json file

Some functionality includes:
- Download a single song
- Download all songs from a mapper
- Delete songs
  - Based on Rating
  - Based on NJS
- Create Playlists
  - Based on Rating
  - Based on NJS
- Add/remove songs to/from SRM banlist

All of these actions will update the query files to keep track of songs

### How do I use this script?

I will usually run through removing songs based on rating once a week after my streams 

I also find it useful to have this script open while watching other Beat Saber streamers. This allows me to quickly download songs or ban songs using the streamer as a guinea pig so I don't have to suffer :D

Feel free to use as you wish! This is just how I find it useful
