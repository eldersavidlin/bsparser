Help parse through Beat Saber songs - Query/Download/Delete

This is a menu driven program that will search through all of the songs in your CustomLevels Beat Saber Directory. It will then query those songs and save the data in a query.json file.

Some functionality includes:
Download a single song based on bsr key
Download all songs from a mapper based on bsr key
Delete songs based on song rating

All of these actions will update the query.json file to keep track of the songs that exist
